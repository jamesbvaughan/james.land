          For this experiment, I wanted to see if browsers retain your text
          selection if the selected text breaks apart spatially.
        </p>

        <p class="explode">
          It turns out that they do! Try selecting some of this text to see.
        </p>

        <p class="explode">
          This mostly works how I'd hoped it would, but there are some issues
          that I haven't resolved:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li class="explode">
            Characters right before or right after the selection are sometimes
            included in the explosion. I think this has to do with the concept
            of "anchor nodes" and "target nodes" in browser selection.
          </li>
          <li class="explode">
            The performance is worse than I'd like, especially for large
            selections. It got a lot better when I moved the
            `selection.containsNode` call outside of the animation loop, but all
            of the CSS updates are still surprisingly slow.
